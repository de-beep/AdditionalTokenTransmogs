# AdditionalTokenTransmogs

AdditionalTokenTransmogs is a World of Warcraft addon that adds tooltip information to various non-tier tokens, allowing you to check whether all available transmogs from those tokens have already been collected.

## Data and Accuracy

The data for this addon is maintained manually, so some errors may occur.

If you find any incorrect data or would like to suggest additional tokens to be supported, please open an issue or contact me on GitHub. I will do my best to keep the data accurate and up to date.

## Supported Tokens

### Dragonflight
- Primalist armor sets

### Battle for Azeroth
- Nazjatar benthic armor
- N'Zoth assault Black Empire armor
